### Drane Lab Software Projects

This is a repository of packaged projects developed through the Drane Lab at Emory University's School of Medicine.

The goal of these projects is to develop modern tests — VR and 2D — for epileptic patients.

## DJV — Deja Vu Project (Fall 2023)
- Stimulate scenes with similar spatial details
- Note: not all of the scenes packaged are in this repository due to size constraints

## EMLT — Multimodal Project (Fall 2023)
- Simulate multimodal tasks on a two-dimensional platform
